# Check the state of a Claude agent managed by herdr.

# Usage: check-agent-state.sh <target>
#   target: herdr pane id (e.g. w13:p2), unique agent name, or terminal id
#
# Output: "idle", "working", "permission", or "starting"
#   idle       - Agent is ready for input (herdr: idle or done)
#   working    - Agent is processing a task
#   permission - Agent is blocked on a prompt/dialog, needs attention
#   starting   - Agent detected but state not yet known
#
# Exits 1 with "error: agent not found" if the target has no detected agent.
#
# Note: startup dialogs may be reported as "idle" by herdr. Do not treat
# "idle" alone as proof of task completion; combine with output checks
# (herdr agent read) or external verification.
